# 🎒 **Knapsack Problem Solver**

---

## 🏫 **About This Project**

Welcome to the **Knapsack Problem Solver** repository! This project serves as my final submission for the **CPE231 - Algorithm Class** course in **Computer Engineering**, **King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT)**.

This project aims to explore and implement multiple algorithms to solve the **Knapsack Problem**, a classic optimization problem, using the following approaches:

- **Brute Force Approach** 🚀
- **Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up & Top-Down)** 💻
- **Genetic Algorithm** 🧬

---

## 📚 **Objective**

The purpose of this project is to:

✅ Compare different methods of solving the knapsack problem.  
✅ Implement multiple problem-solving strategies in C.  
✅ Evaluate and analyze performance across multiple scenarios.  

---

## 💡 **What is the Knapsack Problem?**

The **Knapsack Problem** is a combinatorial optimization problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight and value, and a maximum weight capacity, the goal is to determine the optimal subset of these items to maximize the total value without exceeding the weight limit.

---

## ⚙️ **Algorithms Implemented**

### 1️⃣ **Brute Force Approach**
   - Explores all possible combinations of items using bit manipulation.
   - Finds the optimal subset by evaluating every possible combination.
   - Computationally expensive for large inputs but provides a simple brute-force solution.

---

### 2️⃣ **Dynamic Programming**
   - Bottom-Up DP 🏆:
     Iteratively builds a table from base cases to solve the problem without recursion.
   - Top-Down DP 📉:
     Utilizes recursion and memoization to solve overlapping subproblems efficiently.

---

### 3️⃣ **Genetic Algorithm**
   - Simulates the principles of evolution (selection, mutation, crossover) to find an optimal or near-optimal solution.
   - Uses population-based search methods to explore the solution space.

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Programming Language:** C  
- **Tools:** GCC for compilation  
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code
